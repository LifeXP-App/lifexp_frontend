An AI-powered productivity and self-growth social media platform designed to help users track their daily activities, habits, and personal development through an engaging experience point (XP) system.

Everytime a user posts something, the AI is designed to translate real-life tasks into measurable progress across five fundamental aspects of life:

1. **Physique** - Represents your physical capability, fitness, and endurance.
2. **Logic** - Measures your analytical thinking, reasoning skills, and problem-solving ability.
3. **Creativity** -Captures your originality, imagination, and ability to think beyond convention.
4. **Energy** - Describes your drive, motivation, and day-to-day momentum.
5. **Social** - Represents your interpersonal skill, empathy, and ability to connect with others.

Each activity a user performs contributes XP toward these attributes, shaping a dynamic life chart that reflects personal growth. When a user makes a post, they are prompted to add activities which they can pick from the activities list. Activities list contains a wide range of activities with XP distribution on these 5 aspects of life for the activity when performed at the fundamental level for 1 hour. For example, the activity "Basketball" would contain XP scores when the game is being played for 1 hour. Users would then have to describe the activity they performed along with duration in order to receive a more accurate XP score. In this case, after adding the activity "Basketball", the user adds the description that mentions it was a school tournament along with the duration of 2 hours.
