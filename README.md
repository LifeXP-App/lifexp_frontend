## Product Overview

# **1. Introduction**

**1.1. Overview**
![](https://i.ibb.co/LDys7TBW/1.png)
An AI-powered productivity and self-growth social media platform designed to help users track their daily activities, habits, and personal development through an engaging experience point (XP) system.

Everytime a user posts something, the AI is designed to translate real-life tasks into measurable progress across five fundamental aspects of life:

1. **Physique** - Represents your physical capability, fitness, and endurance.
2. **Logic** - Measures your analytical thinking, reasoning skills, and problem-solving ability.
3. **Creativity** -Captures your originality, imagination, and ability to think beyond convention.
4. **Energy** - Describes your drive, motivation, and day-to-day momentum.
5. **Social** - Represents your interpersonal skill, empathy, and ability to connect with others.

Each activity a user performs contributes XP toward these attributes, shaping a dynamic life chart that reflects personal growth. When a user makes a post, they are prompted to add activities which they can pick from the activities list. Activities list contains a wide range of activities with XP distribution on these 5 aspects of life for the activity when performed at the fundamental level for 1 hour. For example, the activity "Basketball" would contain XP scores when the game is being played for 1 hour. Users would then have to describe the activity they performed along with duration in order to receive a more accurate XP score. In this case, after adding the activity "Basketball", the user adds the description that mentions it was a school tournament along with the duration of 2 hours.

🌟 LifeXP – Turn Your Real-Life Efforts into XP and Level Up Your Life

LifeXP is an AI-powered social media platform that transforms your daily productivity into measurable growth, rewarding you with experience points (XP) and helping you level up in five core aspects of life:

🏋️ Physique | 🔋 Energy | 🧠 Logic | 🎨 Creativity | 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Social

📸 Log Your Experience. Gain XP.

At the core of LifeXP are Experience Posts – a powerful way to capture and quantify your personal growth.

Each post includes:

An image of your productive task (e.g., a sketch, gym photo, notes)

A description of what you did and how it helped you grow

Up to 5 core activities (like Drawing, Running, Chess, Meditation)

A duration in minutes or hours to contextualize the effort

These aren't just posts. They’re progress logs.

LifeXP’s AI analyzes your inputs and awards XP across the 5 life aspects, based on activity type, description content, and duration.

🤖 AI-Powered XP Scoring

Our proprietary AI model assesses your post and distributes XP based on how the activity contributes to:

Physique: Physical wellness, fitness, movement

Energy: Mood, motivation, mental clarity

Logic: Strategy, critical thinking, intellectual challenges

Creativity: Art, music, problem-solving, imaginative work

Social: Communication, empathy, collaboration, community impact

The smarter your habits, the smarter your XP.

🧬 Your Growth Is Your Identity

LifeXP is more than productivity tracking — it’s a gamified self-growth profile.

🎖️ As you gain XP, you:

Level up your Life Level (Level 1, Level 2... harder as you progress)

🕊️ Diplomat – Social

Each mastery track has its own tier:

→ Alchemist I, Alchemist II, Prodigy III, etc.
